regression
Question-23
Use 
sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer
And Yellowbrick
Show confusion matrix and ROCAUC 
using Logistic regression 


#https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)
#check wdbc.data or check  breast_cancer.csv , but use load_breast_cancer() 
#Diagnosis (M = malignant,1, B = benign,0) 
1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

B. Use data/breast_cancer.csv
Use LabelEncoder and MinMaxScalar and Use pipeline 
Then GridSearch on param_grid = dict(lr__C=[0.1, 1, 10])
using Logistic regression
