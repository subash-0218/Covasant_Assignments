Question-20
# A. Daily attendance of bike tracks
every row contains the number of bicycles on every track of the city(montreal), 
for every day of the year.
Can you infer anything from the attendence record?

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndas1971/Misc/master/bikes.csv"

1. Read 
2. Check head 
3. Check summary statistics 
4. plot the daily attendance of two tracks, 'Berri1', 'PierDup'
5. Check index , explore weekday_name attributes 
6. Get sum of all attendance as a function of the weekday
7. Display this in figure , what is the inference?


# B. Titanic-https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
Database of whether somebody survived or not
Can you infer who has survived ?

1. Load the data
2. Which gender survived more 
3. Does it depend on pclass?
4. can we see % of survival of each gender and pclass 
What is your inference? 

# C. Roger Federer database 

Each row corresponds to a ATP match played by Roger Federer

Can you infer anything on Roger Federer performance?

player = 'Roger Federer'
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndas1971/Misc/master/federer.csv"

1. Read and check data 
2. How many % of matched won by our player? ('winner')
3. Proportion of double faults wrt total points in each match 
This number is an indicator of the player's state of mind, his level of self-confidence, 
his willingness to take risks while serving, and other parameters.
columns:
'player1 double faults' and 'player1 total points total'
Display simple stats of above 
4. Average Win per surface 
5. Display the proportion of double faults as a function of the tournament date, 'start date'
Trend: display average double faults in each year 


D. 
Create two frequencies 5Hz and 50Hz sin signals 
Draw FFT components 

E. Plotting normal random numbers
and show that addition of two Gaussian is Gaussian 
and addition of all is Gaussian
